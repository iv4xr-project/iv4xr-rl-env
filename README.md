# iv4XR RL Environment library

This library defines a general interface to define Reinforcement Learning environments through the
iv4XR framework and a connector to work with remote Reinforcement Learning agents in Python.

An example Reinforcement Learning environment is implemented, based on the iv4XR-IntrusionSimulation
system under test.

This project must be linked with iv4XR-IntrusionSimulation, aplib and iv4xrDemo.
See also the iv4XR-trainer project to connect with Python Reinforcement Learning training tools.
